# Not-Noice

After reading the description, I opened the attachment downloaded it and then went to audio decoder online (https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) pasted it uploaded it here and then got a graph thingy in which the flag appeared

# String me to sleep

In this I just opened the file and and searched(ctrl +f) for "OASIS{" and found the flag

# Microsoft StrongEdge

This opens a ppt. Upon checking all of the slides you find nothing hidden in the footer or comments or anything. But while searching in the first slide, as you copy the whole slide you see an element getting copied that is hidden in the bottom right corner, as soon as you enlarge it you get the flag

# Nom-Nom

Inspect the page first, then go to the application, then to cookies, and find the admin key. Change false to true.

# Quenche your thrist

A cypher was decoded using "DLLWB://RGLM.QZ/TUZIOYPJ" as a key, revealing a lengthy text about a protagonist navigating a firewall. The steps involved were:

Bypass the firewall by scanning for vulnerabilities.
Disable autorepair.
Display and disable firewall layers.
Neutralize traps.
Override encryption.
Reset access controls to the servers. After following these steps, the final command would give access to virus controls, potentially saving the OASIS. The key hint was finding repeated letters and adjusting the link to "HTTPS://KATB.IN/YXNZORQJ".

# Stairway to heaven

Run the file on bash, you'll get a colour-coded line with number and letter decoding that gives the flag 

# I have been falling for 30 minutes!

Clicking next on the dialog box when the next option disappears change the url from usr=5 to usr=6 this will give the flag....hours of work gave an idea, before i was inspecting and trying....when i saw the url changing then i tried usr 6 which gave the flag.
